# :red_car: Reinforcement Learning in a 2D Racing Game

In this project we are going to implement a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm in a 2D Racing car game.
The goal of the project is to be able to build and train an autonomous AI to drive along the track. 

## Using the code

You can use the jupyter version of the project with the file ```AsynchronousDoubleDeepQLearning.ipynb```.
The code is quite long but is splitted in several classes that I will explain in this file.

Other useful documents can be found in the **Resources** Folder.
